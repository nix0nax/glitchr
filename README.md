# glitchr
Very simple python script that applies audio effects to video data for datamoshing purposes. 
Uses Pedalboard API. 

Effects are controlled by moving the mouse and the video is closed by pressing q. Because the script is so simple there is no actual UI, you have to change the code to play with different effects. Also has the capability of using your webcam :).


Example of what this script can do:
